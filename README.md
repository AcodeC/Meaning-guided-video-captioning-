# Meaning-guided-video-captioning-
This is the code based on our research paper on meaning guided video captioning. The code is written in pytorch.
Here we describe a new approach to train a video captioning neural network , that is not only based on the normal cross entropy loss for the caption but also uses the meaning of the caption.
